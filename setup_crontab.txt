hi Jack, so on your pi what you want to do is,

crontab -e [USERNAME]
then when you are in the edditor you want to put this line
*/1 * * * * git pull 
NOTE the 5 stars mean every minute
If you find its output annoying just redirect the output to null using following line
> /dev/null  2>&1


I belive that is it!

Have a nice day!!!
