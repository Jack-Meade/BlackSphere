# About
Blacksphere aims to provide a way for users to securely store their files and folders using cloud storage with an emphasis on addressing privacy concerns users might have about services such as Google Drive.

Authentication is provided by means of shared keys, users can share these with friends/colleagues if they so wish. Local and cloud folders are kept in sync automatically.

Users can mount their local directories on to the BlackSphere server so others on the network can access the shared files.
