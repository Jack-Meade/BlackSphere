# BlackSphere
## Very Rough Draft
Our project(Blacksphere) aims to provide a way for users to securely store their files and folders using cloud storage with an emphasis on addressing privacy concerns users might have about services such as Google Drive(Need more reasons/USPs). These concerns are addressed by not having to supply identifying information about themselves (We're not encrypting the data at rest are we?).

 Authentication is provided by means of shared keys, users can share these with friends/colleagues if they so wish. Local and cloud folders are kept in sync automatically.
